# Hello, World!

I'm Xnon, and I'm currently learning game development, among other things. I also dabble in full-stack development. I mostly use GitHub for my personal projects, since it's a great place to host them. Feel free to DM me on Twitter or X if you want to hit me up.

## Setup

- NeoVim and VSCode for writing code.
- Atom's one dark for the theme.
- Linux Mint for work and Windows when I'm stuck at doing something.
- ZSH with Oh-My-Zsh for my shell (robbyrussell theme).
